# GeneHunter
Python Version 3.7

This is a python program that takes a list of gene names in a text file, "geneNames.txt", then searches a genome (fasta file) for the gene names and prints the found genes to a new file. 
This program is called from command line and the files are initialized and opened via command line arguement, sys.argv[]. 

Current functionality will be limited to one text file and one genome at a time.
